# The Open Organization Maturity Model

## Transparency

### Level 1

- Individuals and teams release project materials internally, after work is complete
- People affected by decisions are often surprised to learn about those decisions
- Materials that are part of decision-making practices are available for review when the decision is final
- Individuals and teams are comfortable sharing stories of successes
- Individuals and teams neither contribute to nor draw upon an organizational knowledge commons
- Decision-makers often withhold data and resources without explanation

### Level 2

- Non-sensitive materials are accessible to all members of project teams
- People recognize that leaders are making decisions that affect them
- Materials that are part of decision-making practices are available at certain project milestones
- Individuals and teams are comfortable sharing stories of successes and failures in retrospective fashion
- A "read-only" knowledge commons exists
- Decision-makers withhold data and resources and are clear about what they're not releasing—but not why they're not releasing it

### Level 3

- Non-sensitive materials are accessible to project team and organization at large (possibly outside the organization as well)
- People feel like they know about—and are helping to shape—big decisions as those decisions are unfolding
- Materials that are part of decision-making practices are available for review at the beginning of projects and easily accessible according to known standards
- Individuals and teams are comfortable sharing stories of successes and failures, as well as having difficult conversations during project execution
- A robust and easily-accessible knowledge commons exists, and teams make generous use of it
Individuals and teams understand why certain sensitive materials are not available to them

## Inclusivity

### Level 1

- Organization is working to establish guidelines and channels for encouraging diverse points of view by inviting opinions and participation from anyone who is interested in providing them.
- Protocols and procedures for participating in organization-wide discussions are the result of collaborative efforts.
- Leaders are open to receiving feedback and creating an environment where people feel safe providing it.
- Leaders maintain at least one clear and direct channel for receiving feedback from others, who feel comfortable using it.
- People share materials, but only when asked to, and typically via private channels or discussions.
- Organization encourages leaders to be conscious of voices not present in dialog and to actively seek them out for inclusion.

### Level 2

- Guidelines for sharing and soliciting diverse points of view on company or departmental decisions and are published for anyone to see
- People create materials on organizationally-sanctioned platforms that are accessible to others by default
- Organization can demonstrate that protocols and procedures for participating in organization-wide discussions are the result of collaborative efforts between cross-functional groups that include representation from different functional and geographic teams
- Leaders demonstrate willingness to address and respond to feedback they’ve received, typically in a way that entire teams can see
- Leaders work to establish multiple channels and methods for feedback, and they encourage their use
- Leaders routinely encourage all team members to participate in decision-making practices, and they expressly solicit such participation from parties that may be reluctant to do so

### Level 3

- Guidelines for sharing and soliciting diverse points of view on company or departmental decisions and are published for anyone to see, and an advisory council for maintaining these guidelines exists
- The organization advances clear guidelines for participants' use of collaborative platforms, and encourages the use open technical standards in their work
- Leaders establish multiple channels and methods for feedback, each of which is aligned with people’s preferences for providing it; leaders are reflexive about their attitudes toward feedback and open the feedback processes themselves to feedback from others
- All members of the organization feel empowered and enabled to share opinions constructively on any matter relevant to their work or about which they feel passionate 
- Leaders maintain team-facing or public-facing records of the feedback they’ve received and/or the actions they’ve taken to address this feedback
- The organization assists leaders with specific resources (training programs, access to content, etc.) as they work to hone their strategies for forming inclusive teams

## Adaptability

### Level 1

- Organization routinely solicits feedback from internal stakeholders.
- Organization provides opportunities for members to learn about other aspects of the organization
- Members feel like they understand the organization’s goals
- Organization encourages participants to solve problems by working together
- Failure is a frequent topic of discussion among team members

### Level 2

- Organization promotes an obvious and accessible method for gathering feedback from both internal stakeholders and external parties
- Organization promotes continuous learning with structured programs and events
- Leaders and participants regularly discuss their progress on projects, key metrics and performance indicators, and their roles in the organization’s goals and strategies
- Organization promotes a structured process for collective decision-making, and members use it regularly
- Members understand that failure is an acceptable outcome of experimentation

### Level 3

- Organization expressly allocates resources for collecting, managing, and acting on feedback from external parties and/or stakeholders
- Organization provides clear, structured, process and/or platform members can use to locate collaborative efforts they can join to learn more about and/or participate in a particular organizational function
- Leaders create environments where participants feel comfortable addressing challenges without managerial oversight
- Organization’s decision-making processes are collectively modifiable, and members feel comfortable adjusting their operational behaviors in response to changing conditions
- Leaders cultivate a spirit of experimentation by spotlighting productive failures across the organization

## Collaboration

### Level 1

- Participants share work only after initiating it themselves
- Cross-functional teams can be difficult to build and maintain
- Members frequently work together on projects
- Outcomes of collaboration remain within the team
- Working groups and cross-functional teams often include the same faces and skill sets
- Team revisits the outcomes of collaboration infrequently (or not at all)

### Level 2

- Participants initiate projects as a group
- Cross-functional teams exist with little effort, but roles are often less clearly defined and governance is vague
- Participants enjoy and prefer working together
- Outcomes of collaboration are available to the entire organization
- Groups are always seeking a diverse set of viewpoints, experiences, and skills
- Outcomes of collaboration are the subject of future debate and revision

### Level 3

- Participants help other groups collaborate effectively
- Cross-functional teams exist and roles/goals are posted publicly
- Participants believe working together produces better outcomes
- Outcomes of collaboration are available outside the organization
- Groups effectively leverage members' diverse views and skills
- Outcomes of collaboration see uptake, use, and/or modification outside the organization

## Community

### Level 1

- Members of the group unite to define values and principles 
- People feel welcome to participate in and contribute to the group; an open community aims to create psychological safe spaces, meaning that people are invited to share their thoughts and opinions within the community without fear of retribution
- People understand that the best ideas win and leadership responsibilities emerge based on contribution and commitment; in an open community, leadership is not given; it is earned
- A common language for the community emerges

### Level 2

- Documents expressing shared visions and agreements—like mission statements and [codes of conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/)—are easily accessible and referenced often
- Onboarding materials, personal inductions, and bonding give context to help community members understand how their contribution is needed
- Leaders demonstrate dedication to shared values. They model the behavior their community has determined admirable and help resolve community problems
- Culture comes to life through a common language. Community members make an effort to welcome new members and onboard them, taking time to explain jargon, acronyms, and inside jokes

### Level 3

- Shared values and principles inform decision-making, conflict resolution, and assessment processes.
- People show shared consciousness and empowered execution. They feel agency and responsibility to the community.
- Leaders understand that they grow by helping others grow and mentor more junior community members.
- Mature open communities make an effort to collect and share stories of their community members to attract new members, grow their community, and provide mentorship
